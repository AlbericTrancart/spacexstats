The first in a series of four night launches conducted by SpaceX, AsiaSat 8 was the 11th flight of Falcon 9 and the 3rd geostationary satellite lofted into a high energy geosynchronous transfer orbit.  Announced February 8, 2012 by Hong Kong-based AsiaSat, SpaceX was first scheduled to launch the two approximately 4500kg communications birds in 2014, for a price of $52.2 million per satellite, which well undercut other launch industry prices and was half the price of the backup vehicle: Proton.

Following the Helium-problem-plagued launch campaign of Orbcomm OG2 Launch 2, the preparations for AsiaSat 8 proceeded smoothly, with static firing taking place on 31 July. After integration with the satellite, Falcon 9 was rolled out for launch on August 4, with plans for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 30 scheduled later that night.

The heaviest satellite flown so far, at 4535kg, AsiaSat 8 over 50% of the mass of the two previous birds SpaceX had flown. This precipitated the need for Falcon 9's first stage to provide the highest performance possible, and as such no ocean landing attempt was performed, although it is likely a high velocity reentry test, or a burn to propellant extinction, was planned.

Lifting off well into the early hours of the morning at 4AM EDT, the flight went well, with Falcon 9 placing the 24 Ku-band equipped bird into a 200 by 176km Low Earth parking orbit, inclined 27.7 degrees to the equator. Later, at T+26 minutes, the Merlin Vacuum engine on Falcon 9's second stage relit for 1 minute, providing the extra velocity needed to throw the satellite out to an apogee at geostationary orbital altitude, approximately 35,700km. At T+33 minutes, the spacecraft was separated from the payload adapter.
