Carrying another mass simulator - this time weighing 165kg and nicknamed "RatSat", Falcon 1 for the first time achieved mission success and became the first privately developed liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit on 28 September 2008. Test firing occurred on 20 September, and over the next 8 days some changes were made to a pipeline supplying the second stage Kestrel engine with liquid Oxygen.

Liftoff occurred 15 minutes into a 5 hour launch window. At T+9:31, the second stage engine shut down after reaching orbit, something all 3 Falcon 1 flights prior had failed to accomplish. The initial orbit from this burn was 330x650km. After a short coast period, the second engine of Falcon 1 restarted, and performed a second successful burn placing the mass simulator in a 621x643km orbit with an inclination of 9.35 degrees.

Although original plans for the Falcon 1 were for the first stage to deploy a parachute and splashdown downrange from the launch site to be recovered and reused, no flight succeeded in doing so. Stage recovery was a secondary goal however and not required for mission success.

Elon Musk, the company's founder and CEO, called the launch a "great day for SpaceX" as he addressed the then 500-employee company. The data shows we achieved a super precise orbit insertion--middle of the bull's eye--and then went on to coast and restart the second stage, which was icing on the cake." ... "This is one of the best days of my life."

The next day after completing this historic spaceflight achievement, NASA phoned, with a nearly $2 billion International Space Station resupply contract. "I couldn't even be professional" with them on the phone, Musk said. "I told them, 'I love you.'"

To this day, the Falcon 1 Flight 4 upper stage remains in a 620x640km orbit around the Earth.
