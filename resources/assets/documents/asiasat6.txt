SpaceX was now well into a record-setting year too, AsiaSat 6 provided the 12th launch of Falcon 9, and the 5th this year; all flying out of Launch Complex 40.

Slightly less heavy than its cousin which launched a month before, AsiaSat 6 still has a gross mass that exceeded Falcon 9's capability to perform a downrange ocean landing, thus the rocket flew in its "naked" configuration with no landing legs.

As SpaceX was producing two core variants at the time,
