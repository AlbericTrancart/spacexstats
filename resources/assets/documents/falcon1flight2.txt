SpaceX's second launch of Falcon 1 occurred nearly 1 year after the first spectacular failure where Falcon 1 ended up disintegrating on a nearby reef. Again launched from Omelek Island in Kwajalein Atoll after numerous delays involving computer issues and scheduling conflicts with a Minuteman III test flight which would re-enter of Kwajalein, the second flight of Falcon 1 was much more successful than the first flight which ended shortly after launch, yet also failed to deliver its payload simulator into Earth orbit.

The first stage performed well, and stage separation occurred, yet the interstage bumped the second stage engine nozzle due to higher than expected rotation rates on the rocket, which in turn was caused by an incorrect propellant utilization file being loaded into the engine computer which resulted in slightly lower thrust causing the rocket to be travelling slower and lower than predicted - the additional aerodynamic forces at stage separation imparted more force than they normally would have had the rocket been at the correct altitude, causing the higher-than-expected rotation. Nonetheless, the vehicle performance was within acceptable limits until T+4 minutes 25 seconds.

At this point, a circular corkscrew oscillation began than increased in amplitude until video was lost and the vehicle started to roll at T+5:01, eventually exceeding the capacity of the roll control thrusters to null out the rotation. Finally, the fuel in the tank centrifuged and at T+7:30 the second engine shut down due to flame out. All evidence points to the excess roll being caused by Liquid Oxygen sloshing in the tank - baffles were added in future flights to address this problem.

Falcon 1 eventually coasted to an altitude of 289km with a final velocity of 5.1km/s, short of the 7.5km/s needed to achieve orbit. Regardless, flight 2 was declared a partial success as it flight tested 95% of the rockets componentry.
