Flight 5 delivered SpaceX's first successful commercial payload into orbit, the 180kg RazakSat satellite for the Malaysian government. The uphill journey proceeded smoothly with no problems reported after a liftoff at 3:35 UTC on 14 July 2009 in what was a relatively uneventful flight which was delayed twice, due to stormy weather and an equipment malfunction. Roughly 10 minutes are liftoff, the second stage shutdown, and the Earth observing satellite entered orbit. The upper stage of the vehicle, like flight 4, also remains in orbit to this day.

This marked the last flight for Falcon 1, which first flew in 2006. Only the final 2 missions were successful, with the prior 3 all failing to reach Earth orbit. Initially, an enhanced variant of Falcon 1 was to be its replacement. Named Falcon 1e, it was to be a stretched version with more powerful engines - including a modified upper stage engine named Kestrel 2, and wider payload fairing that would carry 1 ton into Low Earth Orbit for $12 million.

SpaceX however had shifted focus to fulfilling its NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services obligations and so development of Dragon and the much more powerful Falcon 9 were now priority. In doing so, Falcon 1e was put on hold, and as of 2012 "Current plans are for payloads that would fly on Falcon 1 to be served by flights on the Falcon 9, utilizing excess capacity".

Ultimately, Falcon 1 give SpaceX crucial insight and understanding into the process of developing rockets, and remains to date one of only three rockets designed completely in the 21st century, along with Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy.
